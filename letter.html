    <p>
        i miss you very deeply your were like a energiser to me ðŸ˜¹ iâ€™m lying down in bed cause yk i have this meds for depression that i started stopping, like now instead of taking 20mg everyday i take 10mg every 3 days so i kinda have secondary effects. i was watching the tv and yk i was feeling kinda bothered by some thoughts in my head and started getting anxious and quickly put away the remote and go directly to my bed. i closed my eyes and slept for a bit but my dad came to me so i kinda pretend i was okay and not asleep but after he got out of my room i fell like my brain wanted some rest again so i started closing my eyes and i started to hear a scream(?) like yk a lil one and after i heard some stuffs like cartoon effects and yeah it scared me so i quickly opened my eyes and got here. i tweeted on my priv and went here to check our convo. the day you received the notification that you had to go to college and said youâ€™ll do the 1st july and there i started telling you that iâ€™ll be very sad if i couldnâ€™t talk to you everyday  and i said smthg like Â« please donâ€™t abandon me Â» and you said youâ€™ll do all the efforts possible to be by my side everyday and that youâ€™ll never abandon me. so here i am being all nostalgic of the past again, i know itâ€™s hard for you to understand that me being that attached to you when you were just a friend i met online and it wasnâ€™t too much ago too but like, i really was attached to you ash, seriously i was and i just feel like youâ€™re the best friend iâ€™ve ever had cause you are literally perfect from my pov like, if you saw yourself from my point of view youâ€™ll be so so proud of you, i see you like that smart girl whoâ€™s only a year older than me but still has so much things she already accomplished. i really love the way you are, the things you like are all really impressive, youâ€™re captivated by art and iâ€™m captivated by the way you are like, mmh idk how to put it all in words but i just admire you i think, iâ€™m not even saying this words to impress you or something i just think of it (plus youâ€™ll probably never see them cause ill never click on the send button me think) but yeah i just miss you like iâ€™ve never missed someone, i cry everytime i remember i little detail about you. okay maybe iâ€™ll put this thing on the site ik creating for your birthday cause i kinda want you to see that, iâ€™m writing this at 20:07 the 19.08 11 days before your birthday
